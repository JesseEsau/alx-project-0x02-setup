# Next.js Project Setup and Basics.

## Introduction
This project is part of my learning journey in the ALX ProDev Frontend program. It offers hands-on experience in building modern web applications using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project focuses on essential frontend development concepts, including routing with the Pages Router, creating reusable components with TypeScript, handling interactive UI elements like modals and buttons, fetching data from external APIs, and building responsive layouts â€” all while following best practices for structuring a scalable Next.js application.
